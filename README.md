# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.

# 🎵 Music Player with P5.js + SWA + GitHub Actions

<p align="center">
  <img src="./media/p5js-swa-demo.png" alt="Music Player P5.js + SWA" width="100%">
</p>

Music Player in JavaScript using the **[p5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/)** library. The project is based on the following article **[HERE](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2018/03/06/creative-audio-visualizers/)**

The intention of this demo is not to teach about p5.js, but rather to show everyone how easy it is to deploy static applications using the Azure Static Web Apps service and how we can easily integrate with GitHub Actions!

If you want to know a bit more about the p5.js library, I will be providing links and necessary resources about the library here in the README.md

## 🚀 Resources Used

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-gllemos)**
- **[JavaScript library - P5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/)**
- **[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-gllemos)**
- **[VS Code Extension - Azure Static Web Apps](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurestaticwebapps&WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-gllemos)**
- **[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)**
- **[Free Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-gllemos)**

## ⭐️ Account - Azure For Students

If you are a student at a College or University Educational Institution, you can create your account on **[Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-gllemos)**. This account will give you the benefit of having USD 100.00 credit to use the services for free, without needing a credit card. To activate this account, just access the link next to it: **[HERE](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-gllemos)**

## 🔥 Running the Application Locally

Before starting the steps below, it is very important that you run MongoDB locally at this moment!

1) Install the packages with the command: (inside the `src` folder)

```
> npm install
```

2) Then run the following command to run the application (inside the `src` folder):

```
> npm run start
```

Then just open Postman at **localhost:8000** and test the requests

And voilà! :heart: :heart:

## 🐳 Running with Docker

If you prefer to run the application using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t music-player-swa .
```

2. Run the container:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 music-player-swa
```

The application will be available at **localhost:8000**.

## 🔄 GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for automated building and deployment.

### Connecting GitHub to GitLab

1. Create a new project in GitLab.
2. Choose "Import project" > "Repository by URL".
3. Enter the GitHub repository URL: `https://github.com/Aaskritembed/music-player-swa.git`
4. Follow the prompts to import the repository.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines the pipeline with the following stages:

- **Lint**: Runs ESLint to check code quality.
- **Build**: Builds the Docker image and pushes it to the GitLab Container Registry.
- **Deploy**: Pulls the image and runs the container in the production environment.

The pipeline triggers on pushes to the `main` branch.
