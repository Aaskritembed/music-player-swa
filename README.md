<p align="center">
  <img src="./media/p5js-swa-demo.png" alt="Music Player P5.js + SWA" width="100%">
</p>

Music Player in JavaScript using the **[p5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/)** library. The project is based on the following article **[HERE](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2018/03/06/creative-audio-visualizers/)**

The intention of this demo is not to teach about p5.js, but rather to show everyone how easy it is to deploy static applications using the Azure Static Web Apps service and how we can easily integrate with GitHub Actions!

If you want to know a bit more about the p5.js library, I will be providing links and necessary resources about the library here in the README.md

## üöÄ Resources Used

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Account - Azure For Students

If you are a student at a College or University Educational Institution, you can create your account on **[Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-gllemos)**. This account will give you the benefit of having USD 100.00 credit to use the services for free, without needing a credit card. To activate this account, just access the link next to it: **[HERE](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-gllemos)**

## üî• Running the Application Locally

Before starting the steps below, it is very important that you run MongoDB locally at this moment!

1) Install the packages with the command: (inside the `src` folder)

```
> npm install
```

2) Then run the following command to run the application (inside the `src` folder):

```
> npm run start
```

Then just open Postman at **localhost:8000** and test the requests

And voil√†! :heart: :heart:

## üê≥ Running with Docker

If you prefer to run the application using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t music-player-swa .
```

2. Run the container:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 music-player-swa
```

The application will be available at **localhost:8000**.

## üîÑ GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a GitLab CI/CD pipeline for automated building and deployment.

### Connecting GitHub to GitLab

1. Create a new project in GitLab.
2. Choose "Import project" > "Repository by URL".
3. Enter the GitHub repository URL: `https://github.com/Aaskritembed/music-player-swa.git`
4. Follow the prompts to import the repository.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines the pipeline with the following stages:

- **Lint**: Runs ESLint to check code quality.
- **Build**: Builds the Docker image and pushes it to the GitLab Container Registry.
- **Deploy**: Pulls the image and runs the container in the production environment.

The pipeline triggers on pushes to the `main` branch.
